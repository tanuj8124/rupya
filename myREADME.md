SecureBank AI is a modern banking application that integrates financial transactions with a real-time, hybrid AI fraud detection system. It combines a deterministic **Rules Engine** with a probabilistic **Machine Learning Model (Isolation Forest)** to identify and block suspicious activities.

## 🧠 Working Principle: Hybrid Fraud Detection

The core innovation of this project is its **Hybrid Scoring Engine**, which evaluates every transaction capability before execution.

### 1. The Decision Flow
When a user attempts a transfer (`/api/transfer` or `/api/transfer/verify`), the system executes the following pipeline:

1.  **Data Gathering**:
    *   Fetches the user's historical transaction data (7-day average, 1-month velocity).
    *   Identifies the device and location context (mocked for this demo).

2.  **Phase 1: Deterministic Rules Engine (60% Weight)**
    *   Checks for known fraud patterns:
        *   Amount > 3x daily average.
        *   Sudden change in IP/Country.
        *   High transaction velocity (multiple transfers in 1 minute).
    *   **Output**: A base `ruleScore` (0-60).

3.  **Phase 2: ML Anomaly Detection (40% Weight)**
    *   The Next.js backend calls the **Python ML Microservice** (`ml-service`) via HTTP.
    *   **Model**: An **Isolation Forest** model trained on user behavior.
    *   **Features**:
        *   `avg_amount_7d`: Average spending over the last week.
        *   `tx_velocity_1h`: Transaction frequency in the last hour.
        *   `time_of_day_deviation`: How far the transaction time deviates from the user's usual habits.
    *   **Output**: An anomaly score normalized to an `mlScore` (0-40).

4.  **Phase 3: Unified Decision**
    *   Final Score = `ruleScore` + `mlScore`.
    *   **Action**:
        *   **< 30 (Safe)**: Transaction allowed.
        *   **30 - 70 (Suspicious)**: Transaction held for review (`PENDING`).
        *   **> 70 (High Risk)**: Transaction blocked immediately.

5.  **Caching**: To optimize performance, risk scores are cached in **Redis** (Upstash) for 10 minutes.

### 2. Automated Training Pipeline
The ML model is not static. The `ml-service/train.py` script:
1.  Connects directly to the PostgreSQL database.
2.  extracts all transaction history.
3.  Performs feature engineering (calculates rolling averages and time deviations).
4.  Retrains the Isolation Forest model.
5.  Saves the model artifact (`fraud_model.pkl`) for immediate use by the API.
